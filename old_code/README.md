# Rabobank portfolio optimization
This repository contains python scripts used for developing a PoC for portfolio optimization using quantum computing.

This work was done under a Techruption project with TNO and Rabobank:
- Project name: **[TKI-T][MW] TECHRUPTION 2.0B**
- Project number: `060.37679/01.03.05`.

Accompanying documents and presentations can be found on TNO's Sharepoint:
`[TKI-T] [MW] Techruption 2.0A` > `Teams Documents` > `03 Work` > `05 Quantum` > `04 Use Case Rabobank`.
